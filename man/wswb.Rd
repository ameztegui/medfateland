\title{Watershed water balance model}
\description{
A distributed hydrological model that simulates daily water balance on the cells of a watershed while accounting for overland runoff, subsurface flow and groundwater flow between cells.
}
\usage{
wswb(y, SpParams, meteo, dates,
     summaryFreq = "years",
     spwbcontrol = medfate::defaultControl(),
     correctionFactors = defaultWatershedCorrectionFactors())
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{An object of class \code{\link{DistributedWatershed-class}}.}
  \item{SpParams}{A data frame with species parameters (see \code{\link{SpParamsMED}}).}
  \item{meteo}{Input meteorological data (see section details).}
  \item{dates}{A \code{\link{Date}} object describing the days of the period to be modeled.}
  \item{summaryFreq}{Frequency in which summary layers will be produced (e.g. "years", "months", ...) (see \code{\link{cut.Date}}).}
  \item{spwbcontrol}{A list of control parameters (see \code{\link{defaultControl}}) for function \code{\link{spwb}}.}
  \item{correctionFactors}{A list of watershed correction factors for hydraulic parameters.}
}
\details{
Function \code{wswb} requires daily meteorological data over grid cells. The user may supply four different inputs:
\enumerate{
\item{An object of \code{\link{SpatialPixelsMeteorology-class}}.}
\item{An object of \code{\link{MeteorologyInterpolationData-class}}.}
\item{A data frame with information regarding where to read meteorological data.}
\item{A data frame with meteorological data common for all cells of the grid.}
}
In the case of (1), all the spatio-temporal variation of weather is already supplied by the user. In the case of (2), interpolation of weather is done over each grid cell every simulated day. In the case of (3) weather maps are read for each day. Finally, in the case of (4) spatial variation of weather is not considered.
